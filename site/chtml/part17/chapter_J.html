            <p>The DICOM Standard was published in 1993 and addresses medical images communication between medical modalities, workstations and other medical devices as well as data exchange between medical devices and the Information System (IS). DICOM defines SOP Instances with Patient, Visit and Study information managed by the Information System and allows to communicate the Attribute values of these objects.</p>
            <p>Since the publication of the DICOM Standard great effort has been made to harmonize the Information Model of the DICOM Standard with the models of other relevant standards, especially with the HL7 model and the CEN TC 251 WG3 PT 022 model. The result of these effort is a better understanding of the various practical situations in hospitals and an adaptation of the model to these situations. In the discussion of models, the definition of Information Entities and their Identifying Parameters play a very important role.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this Informative Annex is to show which identifying parameters may be included in Image SOP Instances and their related Modality Performed Procedure Step (MPPS) SOP Instance. Different scenarios are elucidated to describe varying levels of integration of the Modality with the Information System, as well as situations in which a connection is temporarily unavailable.</p>

               <p>In this Annex, "Image SOP Instance" is used as a collective term for all Composite Image Storage SOP Instances.</p>

            <p>The scenarios described here are informative and do not constitute a normative section of the DICOM Standard.</p>
