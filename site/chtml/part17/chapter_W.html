The Document would include a Digital Signature according to the Basic SR Digital Signatures Secure Use Profile with the Digital Signature Purpose Code Sequence (0400,0401) of (14,ASTM-sigpurpose, "Source Signature"). It would set the Key Object Selection Document Title of that Instance to (113035,DCM, "Signed Complete Acquisition Content"). Note that the objects that are referenced in the MPPS may or may not have Digital Signatures. By creating the Key Object Selection Document Instance, the archive can in effect add the equivalent of Digital Signatures to the set of objects.</p>
