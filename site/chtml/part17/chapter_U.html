               <p>Ophthalmic mapping usually occurs in the posterior region of the fundus, typically in the macula or the optic disc. However, this or other imaging may occur anywhere in the fundus. The mapping data has clinical relevance only in the context of its location in the fundus, so this must be appropriately defined. <a href="../part16/sect_CID_4207.html" class="olink" shape="rect">CID 4207 “Ophthalmic Image Position”</a> codes and the ocular fundus locations they represent are defined by anatomical landmarks and are described using conventional anatomic references, e.g., superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal. <a class="xref" href="chapter_U.html#figure_U.1.8-1" title="Figure U.1.8-1. Anatomical Landmarks and References of the Left Ocular Fundus" shape="rect">Figure U.1.8-1</a> is a schematic representation of the fundus of the left eye, and provides additional clarification of the anatomic references used in the image location definitions. A schematic of the right eye is omitted since it is identical to the left eye, except horizontally reversed (Temporal→Nasal, Nasal→Temporal).</p>
               <p>The spatial precision of the following location definitions vary depending upon their specific reference. Any location that is described as "centered" is assumed to be positioned in the center of the referenced anatomy. However, the center of the macula can be defined visually with more precision than that of the disc or a lesion. The locations without a "center" reference are approximations of the general quadrant in which the image resides.</p>
