         <p>There will usually be a period of time where a network will have some applications that utilize the configuration management protocols coexisting with applications that are only manually configured. The transition issues arise when a legacy Association Requester interacts with a managed Association Acceptor or when a managed Association Requester interacts with a legacy Association Acceptor. Some of these issues also arise when the Association Requester and Association Acceptor support different configuration management profiles. These are discussed below and some general recommendations made for techniques that simplify the transition to a fully configuration managed network.</p>

            <div class="titlepage">
               <div>

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>The legacy Association Requester requires that the IP address of the Association Acceptor not change dynamically because it lacks the ability to utilize DNS to obtain the current IP address of the Association Acceptor. The legacy Association Requester also requires that the AE Title of the Association Acceptor be provided manually.</p>
            <div class="section">
               <div class="titlepage">
                  <div>

               </div>
               <p>The DHCP server should be configurable with a database of hostname, IP, and MAC address relationships. The DHCP server can be configured to provide the same IP address every time that a particular machine requests an IP address. This is a common requirement for Association Acceptors that obtain IP addresses from DHCP. The Association Acceptor may be identified by either the hardware MAC address or the hostname requested by the Association Acceptor.</p>
               <p>The IP address can be permanently assigned as a static IP address so that legacy Association Requester can be configured to use that IP address while managed Association Requester can utilize the DNS services to obtain its IP address.</p>

               <p>No specific actions are needed, although see below for the potential that the DHCP server does not perform DDNS updates.</p>

               </div>
               <p>Although the managed Association Acceptor may obtain information from the LDAP server, the legacy Association Requester will not. This means that the legacy mechanisms for establishing EYE-Titles and related information on the Association Requester will need to be coordinated manually. Most LDAP products have suitable GUI mechanisms for examining and updating the LDAP database. These are not specified by this standard.</p>
               <p>An LDAP entry for the Association Requester should be manually created, although this may be a very abbreviated entry. It is needed so that the EYE-Title mechanisms can maintain unique AE Titles. There must be entries created for each of the AEs on the legacy Association Requester.</p>
               <p>The legacy Association Requester will need to be configured based on manual examination of the LDAP information for the server and using the legacy procedures for that Association Requester.</p>
