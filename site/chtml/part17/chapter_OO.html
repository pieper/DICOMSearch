               <p>Intra-oral radiography typically involves acquisition of multiple images of various parts of the dentition. Many digital radiographic systems offer customized templates that are used for displaying the images in a study on the screen. These templates may also be referred to as mounts or view sets. The Structured Display Object represents a standard method of encoding and exchanging the layout and intended display of Structured Displays. A structured display object created in this manner could be stored with a study and exchanged with images to allow for complete reproduction of the original exam.</p>

                        <p>A patient visits a General Dentist where a Full Mouth Series Exam with 18 images is acquired. The dentist observes severe bone loss and refers the patient to a Periodontist. The 18 images from the Full Mouth Series along with a Structured Display are copied to a DICOM Interchange CD and sent with the patient to see the specialist. The Periodontist uses the CD to open the exam in his Dental Radiographic Software and consults via phone with the General Dentist. Both are able to observe the same exam showing the images on each user's display using the exact same layout.</p>

               <p>Cardiac stress testing acquires images in at least two patient states, rest and stress, and typically with several different views of the heart to highlight function of different cardiac anatomic regions. Image review typically involves simultaneous display of the same anatomy at two patient states, or multiple anatomic views at one patient state, or even simultaneous display of multiple anatomic views at multiple states. This applies to all cardiac imaging modalities, including ultrasound, nuclear, and MR. The American College of Cardiology and American Society of Nuclear Medicine have adopted standard display layouts for nuclear cardiology rest-stress studies.</p>
