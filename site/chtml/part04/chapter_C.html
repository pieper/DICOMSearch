               <p>The Query/Retrieve Service Class defines an application-level class-of-service that facilitates the simple management of Composite Object Instances in a manner functionally similar to ACR-NEMA 300-1988. The types of queries that are allowed are not complex. This Service Class is not intended to provide a comprehensive generalized database query mechanism such as SQL. Instead, the Query/Retrieve Service Class is focused towards basic Composite Object Instance information queries using a small set of common Key Attributes.</p>
               <p>In addition, the Query/Retrieve Service Class provides the ability to retrieve/transfer a well-identified set of Composite Object Instances. The retrieve/transfer capability allows a DICOM AE to retrieve Composite Object Instances from a remote DICOM AE or request the remote DICOM AE to initiate a transfer of Composite Object Instances to another DICOM AE.</p>

               <p>An Enhanced Multi-Frame Image Conversion Extended Negotiation option allows the Query/Retrieve Service Class to access Classic single-frame images that have been converted to Enhanced multi-frame images, or vice-versa. This is achieved by providing alternative "views" of studies, such that:</p>

               <p>In order to serve as an SCP of the Query/Retrieve Service Class, a DICOM AE possesses information about the Attributes of a number of stored Composite Object Instances. This information is organized into a well defined Query/Retrieve Information Model. The Query/Retrieve Information Model shall be a standard Query/Retrieve Information Model, as defined in this Annex of the DICOM Standard.</p>
               <p>Queries and Retrievals are implemented against well defined Information Models. A specific SOP Class of the Query/Retrieve Service Class consists of an Information Model Definition and a DIMSE-C Service Group. In this Service Class, the Information Model plays a role similar to an Information Object Definition (IOD) of most other DICOM Service Classes.</p>

               <p>Both a baseline and extended behavior is defined for the DIMSE-C C-FIND, C-MOVE, and C-GET services. Baseline behavior specifies a minimum level of conformance for all implementations to facilitate interoperability.
