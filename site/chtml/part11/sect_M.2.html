            <p>This Application Profile Class uses the Media Storage Service Class defined in <a href="../part04/PS3.4.html" class="olink" shape="rect">PS3.4</a> with the Interchange Option.</p>
            <p>The Application Entity shall support one or more of the roles of File Set Creator (FSC) or File Set Reader (FSR), or File Set Updater (FSU) defined in <a href="../part10/PS3.10.html" class="olink" shape="rect">PS3.10</a>.</p>

               <p>The role of File Set Creator shall be used by Application Entities that generate a File Set under this Interchange Class of Application Profiles.</p>
               <p>File Set Creators shall be able to generate the Basic Directory SOP Class in the DICOMDIR file with all the subsidiary Directory Records related to the Image SOP Classes stored in the File Set. The Application Entity acting as a File Set Creator generates a File Set under a STD-GEN-BD or STD-GEN-SEC-BD Application Profile.</p>
               <p>An FSC shall offer the ability to finalize the physical volume at the completion of the most recent write session (no additional information can be subsequently added to the volume), if supported by the media and file system specified in the profile.</p>

                  <p>A multiple volume (i.e., a logical volume that can cross multiple physical media) is not supported by this class of Application profile. If a set of Files, e.g., a Study, cannot be written entirely on one physical volume (side of one piece of media), the FSC will create multiple independent DICOM File Sets such that each File Set can reside on a single physical volume (side of a single piece of media) controlled by its individual DICOMDIR file. The user of the FSC can opt to use written labels on the physical volumes to indicate that there is more than one physical volume for this set of files (e.g., a study).</p>

Typical entities using this role would include image generating systems, display workstations, and archive systems that receive a patient record; e.g., transferred from another institution.</p>
               <p>File Set Readers shall be able to read the DICOMDIR directory file and all the SOP Instance files defined for this Application Profile, for which a Conformance Statement is made, using all the defined Transfer Syntaxes for the Profile.</p>

Typical entities using this role would include image generating systems and workstations that process or modify images.</p>
               <p>File Set Updaters shall be able to generate one or more of the SOP Instances defined for this Application Profile, for which a Conformance Statement is made, and to read and update the DICOMDIR file.</p>

Volume control structures are the structures that are inherent to the standards of the physical volume, see <a href="../part12/PS3.12.html" class="olink" shape="rect">PS3.12</a>.</p>
